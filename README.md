# APOD - Teeny Tiny Sample App

[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) offers a number of [free APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/), exposing interesting Astronomy-related data to application developers. 

The goal of this application is to leverage the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" API and display the picture of the day for the past `number` days. Sometimes the picture is actually a video, so you will need to read the documentation carefully to figure out how to make your API calls.

The application is almost ready, but a few spots still need some work. Search for `TODO` comments with directions on what needs to be implemented, and feel free to ask questions!
